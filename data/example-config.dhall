{- Entangled configuration file
   ============================
 
   This configuration uses the Dhall language, see https://dhall-lang.org/.
 
   This file represents a record, as can be seen from the `let ... in { ... }`
   structure. Configuration for the Entangled daemon and command-line utility
   is stored in the `entangled` member of the record. Other fields are open
   for use by `pandoc` filters or other tools.
 
   If you want to check the configuration for correctness, run
 
       dhall <<< ./entangled.dhall
  -}

{- Schema
   ------
  
   The schema is loaded here. It is recommended to use a schema from a
   released version of Entangled.
  
   The hash is not strictly needed, but it ensures that you get the version
you're
   expecting to, or raise an error. You can generate the correct hash by running

       dhall hash <<< <location to schema>
  -}
let entangled = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/entangled/entangled/v1.3.0/data/config-schema.dhall
                sha256:cb03a230547147223b6bd522c133d16d17921e249e7c2bd505d31bf7729d2cc5

{- Languages
   ---------
  
   Entangled has many programming languages configured by default. If your
   favourite is not in there you can add them here. The most common commenting
   patterns are included in `entangled.comments`
  
        | name         | comment pattern |
        | ------------ | --------------- |
        | hash         | `# ...`         |
        | lispStyle    | `; ...`         |
        | mlStyle      | `(* ... *)`     |
        | cStyle       | `/* ... */`     |
        | cppStyle     | `// ...`        |
        | haskellStyle | `-- ...`        |
        | texStyle     | `% ...`         |
        | xmlStyle     | `<!-- ... -->`  |
    
   The language identifiers are the classes that can be used to identify a code
   block is in a certain language. So,
  
        ``` {.c++ #hello}
        std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
        ```
  
   is recognized as a C++ block, because `c++` is in the identifier list of the C++
   language. In this example we add some esotheric languages.
  -}
let intercalComment = entangled.Comment.Line "PLEASE NOTE: "

let languages = entangled.languages #
    [ { name = "Unlambda", identifiers = ["unlambda"], comment = entangled.comments.hash }
    , { name = "Intercal", identifiers = ["intercal"], comment = intercalComment }
    ]

{- Syntax
   ------

   (new in v1.2.0) You can configure on which syntax Entangled triggers.
   Entangled works entirely on single line matches. From a single line it
   needs to extract a language, reference name and/or a file name.
   The following is the default syntax which works well with Pandoc. However,
   there are other renderers that do not work well with that syntax. In that
   case you may whish to change these settings.
 -}
let syntax : entangled.Syntax =
    { matchCodeStart       = "```[ ]*{[^{}]*}"
    , matchCodeEnd         = "```"
    , extractLanguage      = "```[ ]*{\\.([^{} \t]+)[^{}]*}"
    , extractReferenceName = "```[ ]*{[^{}]*#([^{} \t]*)[^{}]*}"
    , extractFileName      = "```[ ]*{[^{}]*file=([^{} \t]*)[^{}]*}"
    , extractProperty      = \(name : Text) -> "```[ ]*{[^{}]*${name}=([^{} \t]*)[^{}]*}" }

{- Database
   --------
  
   Entangled is powered by SQLite3. This specifies where the database is
   stored.  An entry of `None Text`, which is the default, keeps the database
   in memory, but this way you cannot insert new files on a running daemon.
   Alternatively, you can set the database to ":memory:", which has the same
   effect.
  -}
let database = Some ".entangled/db.sqlite"

{- Watch list
   ----------
  
   List of glob patterns that the daemon needs to watch for changes. The order
   in which files are listed here matters. If code blocks append on previous
   blocks in different files, the blocks are concatenated in the same order as
   the files are listed here. In the case of a glob pattern, this is
   alpha-numerical order (same as `ls`).
  -}
let watchList = [ "lit/*.md" ]

in { entangled = entangled.Config :: { database = database
                                     , watchList = watchList
                                     , languages = languages
                                     , syntax = syntax }

{- Extra options
   -------------

   If you are using Entangled filters (https://github.com/entangled/filters),
   you may want to include some extra configuration here. These settings are
   ignored by the entangled executable.
